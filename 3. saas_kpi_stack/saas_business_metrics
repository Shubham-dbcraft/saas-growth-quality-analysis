The KPI stack below does more than explain how SaaS works. 
It tells you which levers to pull to keep the business stable, predictable, and compounding. 


The SaaS KPI Stack 

1. MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) 
MRR = Sum of all active customer monthly subscriptions 
Why it exists 
• SaaS lives on recurring revenue 
• One-time revenue means nothing here 
When it matters 
• Early to growth stage 
• Used weekly/monthly by leadership 
How it can lie 
• MRR ↑ but churn ↑ 
• Discount-heavy MRR inflates growth 
MRR growth without retention = fake growth 


2. ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) 
ARR = MRR × 12 
ARR is reporting-friendly, 
MRR is decision-friendly. 
Why it exists 
• Standard for investors & large SaaS 
• Smooths monthly volatility 
When it matters 
• Mid–large SaaS 
• Fundraising, valuation 


3. New MRR 
What it is : 
MRR added from new customers only. 
Why it exists 
Separates growth from retention. 
When it matters 
• Sales & marketing performance 
• Funnel efficiency 
Red flag 
High New MRR + flat total MRR = leaky bucket 


4. Churn Rate (MOST IMPORTANT KPI) 
Customer Churn 
Churn % = Customers Lost / Customers at Start 
Revenue Churn 
Revenue Churn = Revenue Lost / Starting Revenue 
Why churn is deadly 
Because churn kills compounding. 
Even: 
• 2% vs 4% monthly churn 
→ massive long-term difference 
When it matters 
• Always 
• Especially post-product-market-fit 
Analyst mindset 
If churn isn’t controlled, nothing else matters. 


5. Retention Rate 
Retention = 1 − Churn 
Why it exists 
Tells how “sticky” the product is. 
Best use 
• Cohort analysis 
• Early warning system 
Pro tip 
Retention by cohort > overall retention. 


6. ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) 
ARPU = Total Revenue / Paying Customers 
Why it exists 
• Measures monetization depth 
• Key input to LTV 
When it matters 
• Pricing decisions 
• Expansion strategy 
Can lie when 
• ARPU ↑ due to discounts removal but churn ↑  


7. Expansion Revenue (THE SAAS SUPERPOWER) 
What it is 
Revenue increase from existing customers. 
Examples: 
• Plan upgrade 
• More users 
• Usage overages 
Why it’s gold 
Expansion revenue: 
• costs almost nothing 
• improves margins 
• increases predictability 
Best SaaS companies grow without new customers. 


8. NRR (Net Revenue Retention)   
The KING KPI 
NRR = (Starting Revenue + Expansion − Churn − Downgrades) / Starting Revenue 
Why it matters 
• NRR > 100% = elite SaaS 
• Business grows even if sales stop 
Benchmarks 
• <90% → danger 
• 90–100% → okay 
• 110% → world-class 
If you remember only one SaaS KPI, remember NRR. 


9. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) 
CAC = Sales + Marketing Spend / New Customers 
Why it exists 
Growth is useless if it’s too expensive. 
When it matters 
• Scaling phase 
• Go-to-market decisions 
Common mistake 
Looking at CAC without LTV. 


10. LTV (Lifetime Value) 
LTV ≈ ARPU × Gross Margin / Churn 
Why it exists 
Shows how much a customer is worth over time. 
Analyst insight 
Small churn changes → huge LTV changes. 


11. LTV / CAC Ratio 
The unit economics truth reminder 
Benchmarks: 
• <2 → losing money 
• ~3 → healthy 
• 5 → very strong 
This KPI decides: 
• whether to scale 
• whether to pause growth 


12. Activation Rate (UNDERRATED) 
What it is 
% of users who reach the aha moment. 
Why it matters 
Bad activation → good acquisition wasted. 
This is where product + analytics meet. 


A Final Thought 
Most SaaS companies don’t fail because they can’t acquire customers. 
They fail because the business underneath acquisition doesn’t compound. 
MRR tells you where you stand today. 
ARR tells others how big you look. 
But churn and NRR decide whether the business survives long enough to matter. 

If you get retention and expansion right, growth becomes predictable. 
If you don’t, growth becomes a treadmill. 
That’s the difference between building a SaaS business — 
and constantly rebuilding one.
